# Task Context: Module Operations Implementation

## Current Implementation
- Core RPC and wallet operations are complete
- Caching system is in place
- All tests passing for existing functionality
- Located in `src/modules/` (to be created)

## Requirements
From communex-reference.txt:
- Module client must handle dynamic endpoint registration
- Support for both HTTP and WebSocket connections
- Whitelist/blacklist functionality for module access
- Secure communication between modules
- Rate limiting per module

## Test Criteria
1. Module Registration
   - Successful registration with valid endpoints
   - Rejection of invalid endpoints
   - Duplicate registration handling
   - Proper cleanup on module shutdown

2. Communication
   - Message passing between modules
   - Error handling for failed communications
   - Timeout handling
   - Rate limit enforcement

3. Security
   - Whitelist/blacklist enforcement
   - Authentication validation
   - Invalid access attempts handling

## Dependencies
- tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
- async-trait = "0.1"
- serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
- Additional dependencies to be determined
