- [x] Cryptographic foundation using Substrate's sr25519
- [x] Basic test suite for types and crypto
- [x] Transaction signing and verification
- [x] RPC client implementation
  - [x] HTTP client setup
  - [x] Request/Response handling
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Batch request support
  - [x] Retry mechanism with configurable attempts
- [x] Query Map Implementation
  - [x] Define query map structure
  - [x] Basic query methods (balance, stake relationships)
  - [x] Batch query support
  - [x] Error handling and validation
  - [x] Configuration validation
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
  - [x] Types and crypto tests
  - [x] RPC client tests with mocked responses
  - [x] Query Map tests
  - [x] Error handling tests

## Current Status

Core functionality is implemented and thoroughly tested. The RPC client is robust with retry mechanisms and proper error handling. Query Map provides a high-level interface with proper validation. All tests are passing with good coverage of edge cases.

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Query Map Caching
   - [ ] Implement caching layer with configurable TTL
   - [ ] Setup background refresh worker (5-minute intervals)
   - [ ] Add cache invalidation strategy
   - [ ] Add metrics for cache hits/misses

2. Wallet Operations
   - [ ] Implement transfer functionality
   - [ ] Add transaction history queries
   - [ ] Add transaction status tracking

### Medium Priority

1. Database Integration
   - [ ] Research and select appropriate database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
   - [ ] Design schema for cached queries
   - [ ] Implement database connection pool
   - [ ] Add migration system

2. CI/CD & Distribution
   - [ ] Setup GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure cargo package
   - [ ] Add automated release process
   - [ ] Setup prebuilt binary distribution

### Low Priority

1. Documentation
   - [ ] Generate API documentation
   - [ ] Add more usage examples
   - [ ] Create integration guide
   - [ ] Document configuration options

2. Monitoring & Observability
   - [ ] Add structured logging
   - [ ] Implement metrics collection
   - [ ] Add tracing support

## Questions/Blockers

1. Database Selection
   - Need to determine if SQLite is sufficient or if PostgreSQL is required
   - Need to define exact caching requirements

2. Distribution Strategy
   - Confirm if crates.io publishing is desired
   - Define supported platforms for prebuilt binaries

3. Configuration Management
   - Define configuration file format
   - Determine if environment variables should be supported
