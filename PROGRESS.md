# Communex Rust API Implementation Progress

## Completed

- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] Key types implementation (Address, Balance, Transaction)
- [x] Cryptographic foundation using Substrate's sr25519
- [x] Basic test suite for types and crypto
- [x] Transaction signing and verification
- [x] RPC client implementation
  - [x] HTTP client setup
  - [x] Request/Response handling
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Batch request support
- [x] Query Map Implementation
  - [x] Define query map structure
  - [x] Basic query methods (balance, stake relationships)
  - [x] Batch query support
  - [x] Error handling and validation

## Current Status

Successfully implemented core cryptographic functionality, RPC client, and Query Map with full test coverage. The RPC client supports both single and batch requests, with proper error handling and timeout configuration. Query Map provides a high-level interface for common blockchain queries with proper validation and error handling.

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Query Map Enhancements
   - Add caching layer
   - Setup background refresh (every 5 minutes)
   - Implement remaining query methods from reference

2. Wallet Interactions
   - Transfer functionality
   - Transaction history

### Medium Priority

1. Database Integration
   - Choose and implement database solution for cache
   - Define schema for cached data
   - Implement cache update/refresh logic

2. Package Distribution
   - Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Configure cargo package
   - Add prebuilt binaries to releases

### Low Priority

1. Documentation
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Integration guide

2. Additional Features
   - Logging system
   - Metrics collection
   - Configuration management

## Questions/Blockers

- Need to confirm database requirements for caching
- Need to verify all required query map methods from reference
- Need to determine exact package distribution requirements
