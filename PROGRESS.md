## Progress Log

### 2024-11-15

#### Performance Testing Results
- Completed comprehensive benchmarking of key operations
- Client Performance:
  - Basic API call: ~343μs
  - Signature generation: ~25μs
  - Signature verification: ~47μs
- Cache Performance:
  - Get operation: ~323ns
  - Set operation: ~9.4μs
  - Mixed hit/miss operations: ~356ns
- All operations show good performance characteristics
- Identified potential areas for optimization in cache set operations

#### Performance Testing Infrastructure
- Added criterion-based benchmarking setup
- Created initial benchmark for ModuleClient operations
- Set up async runtime support for benchmarks
- Added mock server integration for consistent benchmark measurements

#### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- Fixed retry test mechanism in `client_test.rs`
- Improved mock server response handling
- Added proper sequence handling for retry scenarios
- Removed unused imports and cleaned up test code
- All tests now passing successfully

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Cleaned up test infrastructure
- Improved mock server response patterns
- Enhanced retry test reliability
- Removed redundant code and imports
- Improved test readability and maintainability

#### Next Steps
- Continue improving test coverage
- Add more edge case scenarios
- Consider adding performance tests
- Document testing patterns and best practices

## Current Status

Core functionality, wallet operations, and caching are fully implemented and thoroughly tested. The RPC client is robust with retry mechanisms, timeout handling, and proper error handling. Query Map provides a high-level interface with proper validation and caching. All tests are passing with good coverage of edge cases.

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Module Operations
   - [ ] Implement module client
   - [ ] Add module server functionality
   - [ ] Support endpoint definitions
   - [ ] Add whitelist/blacklist functionality

### Medium Priority

1. Database Integration
   - [ ] Research and select appropriate database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
   - [ ] Design schema for cached queries
   - [ ] Implement database connection pool
   - [ ] Add migration system

2. CI/CD & Distribution
   - [ ] Setup GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure cargo package
   - [ ] Add automated release process
   - [ ] Setup prebuilt binary distribution

### Low Priority

1. Documentation
   - [ ] Generate API documentation
   - [ ] Add more usage examples
   - [ ] Create integration guide
   - [ ] Document configuration options

2. Monitoring & Observability
   - [ ] Add structured logging
   - [ ] Implement metrics collection
   - [ ] Add tracing support

## Questions/Blockers

1. Database Selection
   - Need to determine if SQLite is sufficient or if PostgreSQL is required
   - Need to define exact caching requirements

2. Distribution Strategy
   - Confirm if crates.io publishing is desired
   - Define supported platforms for prebuilt binaries

3. Configuration Management
   - Define configuration file format
   - Determine if environment variables should be supported

4. Module System Architecture
   - Define exact module communication protocol
   - Determine security requirements for module interactions
