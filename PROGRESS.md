- [x] Cryptographic foundation using Substrate's sr25519
- [x] Basic test suite for types and crypto
- [x] Transaction signing and verification
- [x] RPC client implementation
  - [x] HTTP client setup
  - [x] Request/Response handling
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Batch request support
  - [x] Retry mechanism with configurable attempts
  - [x] Timeout handling and configuration
- [x] Query Map Implementation
  - [x] Define query map structure
  - [x] Basic query methods (balance, stake relationships)
  - [x] Batch query support
  - [x] Error handling and validation
  - [x] Configuration validation
- [x] Query Map Caching
  - [x] Implement caching layer with configurable TTL
  - [x] Setup background refresh worker (5-minute intervals)
  - [x] Add cache invalidation strategy
  - [x] Add metrics for cache hits/misses
- [x] Wallet Operations
  - [x] Implement basic transfer functionality
  - [x] Add balance query operations
  - [x] Add transaction history queries
  - [x] Add transaction status tracking
  - [x] Implement staking operations
  - [x] Add batch transfer support with timeout handling

## Current Status

Core functionality, wallet operations, and caching are fully implemented and thoroughly tested. The RPC client is robust with retry mechanisms, timeout handling, and proper error handling. Query Map provides a high-level interface with proper validation and caching. All tests are passing with good coverage of edge cases.

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Module Operations
   - [ ] Implement module client
   - [ ] Add module server functionality
   - [ ] Support endpoint definitions
   - [ ] Add whitelist/blacklist functionality

### Medium Priority

1. Database Integration
   - [ ] Research and select appropriate database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
   - [ ] Design schema for cached queries
   - [ ] Implement database connection pool
   - [ ] Add migration system

2. CI/CD & Distribution
   - [ ] Setup GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure cargo package
   - [ ] Add automated release process
   - [ ] Setup prebuilt binary distribution

### Low Priority

1. Documentation
   - [ ] Generate API documentation
   - [ ] Add more usage examples
   - [ ] Create integration guide
   - [ ] Document configuration options

2. Monitoring & Observability
   - [ ] Add structured logging
   - [ ] Implement metrics collection
   - [ ] Add tracing support

## Questions/Blockers

1. Database Selection
   - Need to determine if SQLite is sufficient or if PostgreSQL is required
   - Need to define exact caching requirements

2. Distribution Strategy
   - Confirm if crates.io publishing is desired
   - Define supported platforms for prebuilt binaries

3. Configuration Management
   - Define configuration file format
   - Determine if environment variables should be supported

4. Module System Architecture
   - Define exact module communication protocol
   - Determine security requirements for module interactions
